          <p>
            There are so many parts of your lives that I don't know about.
            Before my life I only have small bits of stories, and unfortunately,
            some of those memories are not as fresh as they once were. I want to
            know your stories about adventures, growing up, humor, and yes
            romance. So I thought of a plan to fix this.

            stories will be added. In the end, each of us will receive a
            physical book containing all the stories we shared. We can all walk
            down memory lane together, or discover unknown parts of our family.

            You will not be asked to write 52 stories! The number of prompts
            will be dispersed between the Long, Milne family, and those who may
            not be family but actually are. I only ask that you complete 12 of
            these this coming year, or one a month. You may receive more
            prompts, but a response to every one of them is not required! Maybe
            you can write a ten page story, maybe two paragraphs, there is no
            minimum! Even the idea of the story is enough to spark curiousity
            and perhaps a little in-person elaboration!
